# 🏥 Biodesign Methodology with LLM Agent

> A Stanford University methodology for systematic medical device innovation, enhanced with multi-agent LLM implementation for intelligent medical needs analysis

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project implements the Stanford Biodesign Methodology using a sophisticated multi-agent LLM system to systematize and enhance the medical device innovation process. The system features specialized AI agents (Medical Expert, Systems Engineer, and Needs Collector) that collaborate to identify and analyze healthcare needs through structured discussions.

## 📚 What is Biodesign?

Biodesign is a systematic approach to medical device innovation developed by Stanford University. The methodology consists of three core phases:

### 1. Identify 🔍
This phase focuses on discovering significant unmet healthcare needs through:
- Clinical environment immersion
- Observation of complete care cycles (diagnosis → treatment → recovery → billing)
- Problem and opportunity identification
- Need gathering and prioritization based on potential impact

### 2. Invent 💡
During this phase, teams:
- Brainstorm diverse solution concepts
- Create and test rapid prototypes
- Implement "think-build-rethink" iteration cycles
- Evaluate concepts for:
  - Technical feasibility
  - Intellectual property potential
  - Business model viability
  - Regulatory pathway considerations

### 3. Implement 🚀
The final phase involves:
- Technology refinement
- Development of regulatory approval strategies
- Reimbursement planning
- Market potential assessment
- Funding source exploration
- Collaboration with industry mentors

## 🤖 Multi-Agent System

This implementation enhances the Biodesign methodology with three specialized AI agents:

- **🩺 Medical Expert Agent**: Analyzes healthcare needs from clinical and medical perspectives
- **⚙️ Systems Engineer Agent**: Provides technical solutions and system optimization insights  
- **📋 Needs Collector Agent**: Synthesizes discussions and extracts actionable medical device requirements
