# Biodesign Methodology with LLM Agent

> A Stanford University methodology for systematic medical device innovation, enhanced with LLM agent implementation

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project aims to implement the Biodesign Methodology using LLM (Large Language Model) agents to systematize and enhance the medical device innovation process.

## 📚 What is Biodesign?

Biodesign is a systematic approach to medical device innovation developed by Stanford University. The methodology consists of three core phases:

### 1. Identify 🔍
This phase focuses on discovering significant unmet healthcare needs through:
- Clinical environment immersion
- Observation of complete care cycles (diagnosis → treatment → recovery → billing)
- Problem and opportunity identification
- Need gathering and prioritization based on potential impact

### 2. Invent 💡
During this phase, teams:
- Brainstorm diverse solution concepts
- Create and test rapid prototypes
- Implement "think-build-rethink" iteration cycles
- Evaluate concepts for:
  - Technical feasibility
  - Intellectual property potential
  - Business model viability
  - Regulatory pathway considerations

### 3. Implement 🚀
The final phase involves:
- Technology refinement
- Development of regulatory approval strategies
- Reimbursement planning
- Market potential assessment
- Funding source exploration
- Collaboration with industry mentors
